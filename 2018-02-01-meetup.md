- Thinking we will conduct meetup monthly.
- Google & UPMC Enterprises will probably be next hosts.

## RBAC
Tyler Auerbeck, UPMC Enterprises
- "You don't delete me, I won't delete you."
- RBAC helps you ease into the new world of shared responsibility. Can start with teams sticking to their "old" duties.
- Don't touch system roles. You'll break them.
  + Okay to group them together though. Think of them as legos.
- Keep RBAC files in source control. Managed by platform team. Act as configuration objects.
  + Can test them in the same way of other configuration files.
- k8s used differerently by different teams
  + non-prod workloads. Just kicking the tires.
  + Others using for production workloads. Deploying to them from their CI pipelines.
- Namespaces would have logically separated resources but not prevented bad actors from doing their deeds.
- Best practice: create roles for your app and ship them with your deployment.
- Four main pieces:
 + Roles - namespaced.
 + Cluster roles - apply at the cluster level. Not namespaced.
 + Role bindings - how you bind the permissions in roles to a certain person or group of users.
 + Cluster role bindings
- Can limit to apiGroups, resources (deployments, jobs, secrets, etc.), HTTP verbs
 + Can create custom API groups
- Can aggregate roles from other roles
- RBAC is great for cross-department clusters. Not perfect for multi-tenant environment.
- Best practice: use namespaces as containment layer for various groups/departments.
- Don't ticket bomb people. We're moving to this world, because this allows us to move rapidly.
- RBAC shouldn't be thought of the thing that is preventing me from doing what I need. 
- How do you authenticate against RBAC roles?
  + Can use X.509 or OpenId. Please don't use static passwords or tokens.

## Top 10 Kubernetes Tips/Tricks
Steve Sloka, Heptio
1. Auto-complete kubectl commands (Bash or Zsh)
  - Source this once.
2. `kubectl explain [resource]` - get information about your resources in k8s
3. `minikube` - share docker daemon. Allows you to run Docker within minikube environment.
  `eval $(minikube docker-env)`
4. Logs from multiple pods - from kubetail  
  Tails logs from all pods across replica set.
5. Kubernetes the hard way. From Kelsey Hightower's GitHub account. Best practices around running k8s clusters on your own. Built against GCP, but there are 1,000 forks.
6. RBAC policies.  
  [`audit2rbac`](https://github.com/liggit/audit2rbac) - tracks what you do against the API, designs RBAC policy based on what you do.
7. Kubecon - https://goo.gl/c2BvSL
8. Add default memory limits and CPU limits to namespaces.  If you don't give constraints to your application, scheduler has no idea where to place your pods. If you don't define the limit ranges, namespace default will be applied. Can do memory, request size, & maybe CPU. Although if your container exceeds CPU, your pod will be killed.
9. Pod disruption budget. Will ensure that workloads are working across the cluster based on the minimum defined in the PodDisruptionBudget.
10. kuard. https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running/kuard.  Have a sample called `kuard` that explains everything about a pod and its supporting infrastructure. Also allows you to simulate failures. Like a k8s test harness.
